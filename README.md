# Add companies and startups to the map ðŸš€

- go to [script.js](https://github.com/ssantoshp/TheSuperSiliconValleyMap/blob/main/script.js)
- add a new company by adding their logo and their coordinates (you can use [google maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=0) to get them). The code you add to script.js should look like that :
```
      [
			'Pinterest',                          #name of the company
			37.77788300973486,                    #latitude
                        -122.39690640178195,                  #longitude 
			'assets/pin.png',                     #logo of the company
			70,                                   #size of the picture
			50,                                   #size of the picture
         ],
